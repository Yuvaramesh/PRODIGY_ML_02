### 🔍 Another Milestone Achieved! 🔍

**Exciting news to share! 🚀 I've successfully completed Task 2 of my virtual internship at Prodigy!
In this phase of the project, I've delved into the fascinating world of customer segmentation using K-means clustering. 🛍️ By analyzing the purchase history of customers at a retail store, I've employed advanced clustering techniques to group them based on their shopping behaviors and preferences.
It's been an eye-opening experience exploring how data-driven insights can enhance marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. 💡 I've gained valuable skills in data analysis, clustering algorithms, and interpreting results to drive business decisions.
A huge thank you to the incredible team at Prodigy for their continuous support and mentorship throughout this journey. I'm excited to apply these learnings to future projects and contribute to innovative solutions in the retail industry.**
